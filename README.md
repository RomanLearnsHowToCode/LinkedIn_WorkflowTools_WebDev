# LinkedIn_WorkflowTools_WebDev 

A course provided by Christina Truong, I would like to use some code snippets, specially the media queries (red, green, blue border-top), SCSS and other in my personal project..
There might be a new "test version" of some features commited soon, since I would like to adopt the mobile first aproach..
